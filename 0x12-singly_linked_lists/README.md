In this directory, we demonstrate the use of singly linked lists,with functions in the files, as follows:


0-print_list.c - prints all the elements of a `list_t` list. If the `str` is `NULL`, it should print `[0] (nil)`.

1-list_len.c - returns the number of elements in a `list_t` list.

2-add_node.c - adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

3-add_node_end.c - adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list. The `str` value should be duplicated, and it should return the address of the new element.


4-free_list.c - frees a `list_t` list, ensuring there are no memory leaks.

00-first.c - prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

101-hello_holberton.asm - a 64 bit assemblyy that prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line using only the `printf` function and no interrupts.
